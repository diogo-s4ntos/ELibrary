# ELibrary
A webpage where you can register and add books that you have read, along with a description of what you felt and thought about the book. You can also see other people's opinions about the same book or other books. In the future, I plan to add some new features, such as commenting on other people's book descriptions, editing your own description, and a few more things. (The website doesn't have SSL certification yet).
